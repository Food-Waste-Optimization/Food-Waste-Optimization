# Possible Development Targets for Future

The current software structure and developmental phase allows several possible ways to advance further. Here are listed some of the ideas that came up during the development.

## Back End

- Utilising CO2-data in AI-model, perhaps estimating CO2 per day


## Front End

- Front end structure currently has components for admin view and for data upload. Both of these lack functionality. If needed, these can be added later.  
- Improving chart sizes and layout. Also for different screen sizes.  

## Database

- Moving from test database to production database. This will allow more testing to be done with the test database without compromising production.  


## Testing

- The software is in need of much more testing. A big road block to testing is a successful database integration, which we were able to start at the end of the project, but it still needs some work.

- Model testing and cross-validation are not done currently.
