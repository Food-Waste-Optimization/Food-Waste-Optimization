# Commit practices

New commits are made in own branches, not in main (see [branching practices](branching-practices.md)).

Commit messages should be written by following the following guidelines:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*
